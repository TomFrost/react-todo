This is a simple Todo App sample built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com) and built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

The project also uses [Lodash](http://lodash.com) to reduce the complexity of some simpler operations, allowing more focus on the React end.
